# Problem Statement
For my project my goal was to create an image classifier neural network model that is built specifically to classify common household items with at least 75% accuracy, this classification will take place across 10 items; clock, computer keyboard, lamp, telephone, television, bed, chair, couch, table, and wardrobe. I originally was just going to make one model for this, however after discovering different strategies for accomplishing this task I ended up creating 3 different models, one using a modified ResNet, another using a modified AlexNet, and finally a Simple neural network I designed myself. My goal became to train these neural networks on the same data and see which generalized the best and try to understand why.
# Data
The data I used for this project was collected from the CIFAR-100 dataset on kaggle. This dataset contains 100 different classes, but because I am making a model that works specifically for furniture, I needed to extract the 10 classes described in the problem statement from the dataset. This gave me 4000 training images, 1000 validation images, and 1000 test images. This data also required the use of an unpickling function described by the owner of the dataset on kaggle, this function was necessary to properly load the data. After the data is loaded, I needed to reshape the data so the channels of the image were referenced by the first index. This was necessary to convert the data into an Image class as defined in python's PIL library. Once the data is converted into the Image class, I finally transform the data using a transform function I defined to preprocess instances of the Image class into the format expected by my neural networks. The labels of the images were much simpler, and all I had to do was extract the labels corresponding to the Images I was using and ensure they retained the same index as their respective Image. After
